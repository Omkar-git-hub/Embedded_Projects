*** Automatic Drip Irigation For Garden ***
This embedded project aims to develop an automatic drip irrigation system that efficiently manages water usage in home gardens.
By using sensors, microcontrollers, and actuators, the system will monitor soil moisture levels and trigger irrigation when required. 
The goal is to create a sustainable, time-efficient, and water-conserving solution for gardening, especially in areas with limited water resources.

Components:
Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi): Acts as the brain of the system, processing sensor inputs and controlling the water pump.
Soil Moisture Sensors: Measure the moisture level in the soil to determine when watering is needed.
Water Pump/Valve: Controls the flow of water to the plants through the drip irrigation pipes.
Relay Module: Used to control the water pump/valve based on the microcontroller's instructions.
LCD Display (Optional): Displays real-time data such as soil moisture levels or system status.
Power Supply: Provides power to the system, including the microcontroller, sensors, and pump.
Water Tank (Optional): Stores water for the irrigation system.
Real-time Clock Module (Optional): Allows scheduling of irrigation based on specific times of the day.

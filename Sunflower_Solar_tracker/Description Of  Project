*******Description of Sunflower Solar Tracking System ********

The Sunflower Solar Tracking System is an innovative embedded system designed to maximize the efficiency of solar energy collection by mimicking the natural movement of sunflower plants. 
The system uses an automated mechanism to track the sun's position throughout the day, optimizing the angle of solar panels to capture the maximum amount of sunlight. 
By using sensors, motors, and microcontrollers, this system enhances the performance of solar panels and contributes to more efficient renewable energy generation.

Components:
Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino): Controls the overall system by processing sensor data and controlling the motors.
Light Sensors (e.g., LDR – Light Dependent Resistors): Detect the intensity of sunlight from different directions and send the data to the microcontroller for analysis.
Servo Motors/Stepper Motors: Control the movement of the solar panel or array to adjust its orientation in response to sensor input.
Solar Panel: The main component that captures sunlight and converts it into electrical energy.
Rotational Mechanism: A set of gears or actuators that allow the solar panel to tilt and rotate to follow the sun’s movement.
Power Supply: Provides power to the sensors, motors, and microcontroller, and may include an optional solar panel to power the system itself.
Display (Optional): An LCD or LED screen that shows real-time system data such as current panel angle, sun intensity, and energy generation.

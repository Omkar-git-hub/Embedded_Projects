******** Description of Obstacle Avoidance Project ********

The Obstacle Avoiding Robot is an autonomous robot designed to navigate through an environment while avoiding obstacles in its path. 
Utilizing a combination of sensors, motors, and an intelligent control system, the robot can detect and respond to obstacles in real-time, making it capable of moving safely through complex terrains.
This project focuses on creating a robot that can be used in various applications such as indoor navigation, delivery systems, or search and rescue operations.

Components:
Microcontroller (e.g. Arduino): Acts as the central control unit that processes sensor data and controls the movement of the robot.
Ultrasonic Sensors: Used to detect obstacles in the robotâ€™s path by measuring the distance to nearby objects. Typically, two or more ultrasonic sensors are placed on the front and sides of the robot.
DC Motors with Motor Driver: Drive the robot's wheels and allow it to move forward, backward, and turn. The motor driver controls the speed and direction of the motors.
Wheels and Chassis: Provides the structure and mobility for the robot, supporting the motors and sensors.
Power Supply: A battery pack or power source to provide energy for the robot's motors, sensors, and microcontroller.
Buzzer or LED Indicators (Optional): Alerts the user when the robot encounters an obstacle or requires attention.
IR Sensors or Line Sensors (Optional): Can be added for line-following capabilities or additional obstacle detection in some designs.
Wireless Module (Optional): Allows remote control or monitoring via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or other communication methods.
Servo Motors (Optional): Can be used for additional movement capabilities, such as rotating the sensors or extending other features.
